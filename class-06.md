# Problem Domain objects, and the DOM

## Object Literals

According to the Javascript book on page 100, Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of somthing you would recognize from the real world. Object variables take on properties if a function is part of an object it is than called a method. (pg 100 in Javascript book.)

## DOM

DOM stands for Document object model it can specify how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how javascript can access and update the contents of the page while it is in the browser window.

## Understandg the problem Domain 

It is described in the article that "writing code and working the problem domain is like trying to build a puzzel with a blurry picture or no picture to reference. Programing can be difficult without having the necessary information needed.

## The difference between a primitive valuse and object references in Javascript.

There are eight data types, Boolean, Null, undefined, number, Big int, string, symbol and objects. The difference between a value and a reference is when a primitive value is assigned to a variable. The Variable is set to that value to directly (from summary in article.). Common data types for example are arrays, functions, and dates are object references under the hood.
