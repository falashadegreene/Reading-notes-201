# HTML links, CSS layout, JS Functions

## Links

Links are an essential part of navigating the web. The common links we find are links that take us from one website to another, links that open in a new browser and links that help us move from one part of the page to another. You can create a link by wraping a `<a>` tag around a href hyper link and text the user will click on. Example: `<a href= "https://website.com">text</a>`

## Layout

positioning elements that fit to the screen depending on device is creating a layout for your page. Using normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positioning, fixed positioning and floats all assist in controlling elements on your page. When designing for different screen sizes you can use a feature called media queries to help size your element to fit to a speciific type of screen. Grid and Liquid layouts are another way for creating layouts that stretch to the size of the users screen or shrink to size.

Functions and methods are a list of statments that are grouped together because they can perform a certain task. Objects are what programmers use to create models of the world using data (pg 86).
