# Basics of HTML lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Basic Javascript Instructions

According to Page 70-73 in the HTML book, Arrays are a unique variable that can store a list of values like strings, numbers and Boolean, or all values together in the same arrary. The values are assigned to the arrary and each item in the array is given a number called index which gives access to specific items. Example of an array below:

let colors = ['blue', 'green', 'red'];

## Decisions and Loops

If else statements are checking the conditions. If it renders true the first code block will work. If the condition is false the second code block will work. Truthy and Falsy values in Javascript can be read as truth or false. Example of a truthy value is 'true' or 1. Falsy values can be 'false' or 0. Loops are used to repeat a set of statements. Examples of loops are for, while and do while loops.

## lists

Lists are contents on a page that can be numbered, bullet points, or listed out defining terms. Ordered list in HTML (ol) are rendered as number lists. Unordered list (ul) show up as bullet points and wrapped around with `<li>`tags with content. Definition list are used to define terms. Example of tags used in HTML `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>`.

## Boxes

HTML treats every element as if it lives in it's own separate box. These boxes can be controlled by css by changing the dimension, creating borders, padding and margin. You can also hide the visibility of a box make it visiable. Creating box-shadows and border-radius are many ways you can completely change the box into other shapes.
