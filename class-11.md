# Audio, Video, Images

## Images 

You can control the size of an image using the width and height rule set in CSS. Specifying the image sizes helps the page to load smoothy due to the HTML and CSS code loading before the images, communicating with the browser on how much space to leave for the image and allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download. Example code: 
`img{
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
}`

## Practical information 

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and understanding analytics of your webpage are key to maintaining a successful webpage. SEO is helping your site appear nearer to the top of the search engine results (pg. 479 HTML book). Analytics are important in helping you understand when your vistors start viewing your site and at which point they leave your site. 

## Video and Audio 

HTML5 allows for us to embed video and audio into webpages with the tag elements `<video>` and `<audio>`. HTML5 features attributes like `controls` which enables the default set of playback controls. Without the `controls` attribute you won't have playback controls on your video.
