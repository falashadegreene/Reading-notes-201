# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

## Text

HTML text is made up of Markup tags that are displayed appropriately by the browser to create the structure of a webpage. Markup tags can be both inline or block level tags. For example, an inline tag is `<b>` or `<i>`. Inline tags are placed on the same line as the code. An example of a block level tag is `<h1>` or `<p>` which are displayed by importance or have a hierarchy. Or in other words they are called semantic markup that is used to define the elements of your page.

## Introducing CSS

Cascading style sheets are essentially the designing of your webpage. You can use CSS to create the styling of your page by creating rule sets that include curly braces `}` and semicolons `;`. The rule sets control the design of your HTML elements. CSS creates an invisible box around your HTML element where you can manipulate and design the layout to your desired look.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

`<script>` are a lists of instructions that computers read and breakdown into steps. In Javascripts it is called a statement. After the statement there is a series of code (code blocks) seperated by a semicolon. When writing your code it is considered good practice to included comments on your code to help with understanding and organization. Example: `/* code block starts here */`. Variables, Expressions & Operators are the componets that make up Javascript instructions. Variables are where data is stored. Expressions evaluates into resluts.(credit. pg 74 in Javascript & JQuery book). Operators can be assignment, comparison, arithmetic, logical or string Operators.

## Decisions and Loops

Dependent on how the user interactes with your webpage developers can control the flow of their code to take multipule paths. This can include comparison Operators which can include a greater than `>` or Less than `<` symbol to compare values to meet a condition. Loops in Javascript are used to execute repeated tasks depending on the condition.
