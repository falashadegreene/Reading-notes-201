# Error Handling and Debugging

Javascript can be difficult to learn and while learning it can also be hard to write properly while building instructions for the computer. There are tools built into the browser that can help find errors within your code, like the console and Dev tools. Understanding how scripts are processed helps with writing proper syntax. According to page 452 in the JS book, the order in which statements are executed are important to know because some tasks cannot complete until another statment or function has been run. The Javascript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. Logging data to the console is another way to check if Javascript is running properly by using the `console.log();` method. The console can help with narrowing down the area in which the error is located so you find the error.
