# Layout

CSS displays HTML elements as their own separate box. These boxes can be block-level or in-line boxes. CSS allows you to control those invisible box elements by positioning them for the layout of your HTML page. According to page 363 in the layout chapter you can specify the positioning using the position property in CSS. Normal flow, relative positioning, absolute positiong, fixed positioning are all examples of different properites that can be used to help with desigining your layout. When setting your position property you can then use float to move your elements around on the page. When creating your layout you will need to consider different screen sizes for each user. You can use fixed width layouts, liquid layouts or grid layouts to adjust to your users screen.
