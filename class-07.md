# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Tables 

Tables are great for representing data/information in a grid format. Tables can be used for reports, time schedules and sports results. The structure of tables a can mirror a grid with information displayed on two axes (The vertical axes and horizontal axes). According to pg 130, each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. HTML table tags are made up of `<table>` `<tr>` `<td>` `<th>` `<Thead>` `<tbody>` `<tfoot>`

## Functions,Methods,and objects

In Pg 108 in the JS book, object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects first. You can create instances of the objects using the constructor function. A new keyword followed by a call creates a new object.(pg 109).

## Domain Modeling

According to the reading in the (article Domain modeling) Domain Modeling is creating a conceptual model in code for a specfic problem. The model can describe the object and its behavior and parameters that govern the problem domain.
